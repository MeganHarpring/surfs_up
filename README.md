# Surfs_Up

### Analysis:

##### **Overview and Purpose:**
Our boss wants us to help him determine where the best location is in Hawaii for him to put his surf and ice cream shop. We will find out the temperature and temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu. This analysis will help him by determining if the business and sustainable year-round.

##### **Results**
Below are the summary statistics we found for each month of June and December.

 As you can see above the results are not very drastic from June to December like one would think. 
 - The average temp in June was 74.9 and the average temp in December was 71.04 so almost a 4 degree difference. 4 degrees is really not much of a difference as far as temperature going and I think that the business would have likely similar sales for both December and June in terms of temperature. 
 - Now there is a little bit bigger of a gap with the minimum temperature; for June the min temp is 64 and December is 56. That is an 8 degree difference but again I would say this won't effect the sales that much if we are only speaking in terms of termperature. There may be a little less in December on colder days. 
 - Lastly, the maximum temp for June is 85 and the max for December is 83 which is on a 2 degree difference, our smallest yet. So as far as high temps go, they won't make the business change much baseed on the high temps in each month. 


##### **Summary**

We can see that because of Hawaii's location in the world, there is not a huge difference in temperature season to season. I don't believe temperature will play a very big roll in regards to effect business sustainability.
- One other query we could run to check to see if it has effected sales is to look at how much parcipitation there is in Ohau in June and December. A lot of rain could effect the number of sale of the surf and ice cream shop because rain typically deters people away. People like ice cream and probably surfing when it is warmer and sunny outside. 
- Another query that could be run is statistics on wind maybe? I don't know much about surfing but wind effects the size of waves those effecting how many people will be out surfing or looking to surf which could increase sales. We can wee how wind effect wave size and when surfers surf the most in relation to wave size. 
- Lasty, we can look at overall weather and determine the busiest tourist season. When there are more tourist there is going to be more more ice cream and surfing sales. These statistic can help quite a bit in discovering the best location to put the shop.
